      mtk: "American Jews form the largest Jewish community outside of Israel, with approximately 5.7 million people. They have a rich history of immigration, settling in the United States since colonial times and contributing to the nation's cultural, economic, and intellectual development. American Jews encompass diverse religious affiliations, including Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist Judaism, as well as secular and cultural identities. They have made significant contributions to various fields and have been actively engaged in social and political causes. The Holocaust has had a profound impact on Jewish identity, and support for Israel remains an important aspect for many American Jews. They have established numerous communal institutions and face ongoing challenges, including anti-Semitism."
